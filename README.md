# Image-InPainting-with-Masked-Autoencoders
This project implements Masked Autoencoders (MAE), a scalable self-supervised learner for computer vision. By masking random patches of an input image and reconstructing the missing pixels, the model learns high-level visual representations that are effective for image inpainting and downstream tasks.
